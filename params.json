One, two! and through and through\r\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\r\nHe left it dead, and with its head\r\nHe went galumphing back.\r\n\r\n\"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\r\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\r\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"\r\nHe chortled in his joy.\r\n\r\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\r\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\r\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\r\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
