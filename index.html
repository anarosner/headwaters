<h3>
<a name="jabberwocky" class="anchor" href="#jabberwocky"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jabberwocky</h3>

<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

<p>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"</p>

<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.</p>

<p>And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!</p>

<p>One, two! One, two! and through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.</p>

<p>"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
He chortled in his joy.</p>

<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
